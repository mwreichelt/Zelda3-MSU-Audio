Zelda3-MSU-Audio
================

##Gimmie the quick version?
Go [here](https://github.com/qwertymodo/MSU1-Zelda) and check out this patch! It's better than my own and was written by Conn79. You can find a link to the patch's development thread [here](http://www.zeldix.net/t453-enable-msu-streaming-music).

##Yeah, but I wanna know more about this project for some reason. Again, gimmie the quick version.
Go [here](https://github.com/mwreichelt/Zelda3-MSU-Audio/wiki/Getting-Started) and start reading!

##What is this nonsense?
This is a patch for Zelda 3 designed to use the MSU-1 chip in an SD2SNES cartridge to play CD quality audio on a real SNES.

##What's Zelda 3?
Sorry, I mean The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Sometimes called The Legend of Zelda: Triforce of the Gods. Sometimes called Zelda 3.

##What? Oh god, I want that!
Cool, go download the latest stable release and have at.

##Hey, I know someone who is charging money for a patch similar to this.
Don't pay money for romhack patches. Help improve this patch that is being distributed for free.

##What's stopping me from taking this patch and charging money for it?
I guess I'm just counting on you not being a giant scumbag about this. You'd have to sell it to people who don't realize that they could get it for free, though, and if they found out they could get it for free they probably wouldn't want to give you money for other things in the future.

##Why isn't the ROM included with the download package?!
It's illegal to distribute the ROM. I'm not gonna do it, so don't ask again.

##Where can I get the ROM?
You'll have to figure that one out on your own, Sherlock.

##What _kind_ of ROM do I need?
I've only tried it on a headerless American release ROM. I've heard whispers from the internet that it will work on any release version of the game except the original Japanese release with all those neat glitches that speedrunners like.

##I downloaded your package and there's no way this covers every song in the game!
You're right, it doesn't. Refer to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/mwreichelt/Zelda3-MSU-Audio/wiki/Getting-Started) section for more complete info, but basically, I don't have the rights to redistribute a complete soundtrack replacement for the game. So I offer what I can and then tell you where to find more and make your own substitutions. I've done my best to make sure that the initial patch will fall back onto the original soundtrack built into the game when you do not provide a new song for it, but currently there are some catches for that depending on what platform you're playing the game on (read: that feature doesn't work right now on emulator, so it's all CD audio or nothin').

##What platforms can I use this patch on?
The patch currently works on bSNES v075 (mostly) and on the SNES cartridges equipped with the MSU-1 co-processor.

##Wait, so, I can play A Link to the Past with CD quality audio on an actual SNES?!
Yes. You will need a flashcart with the MSU-1 co-processor chip implemented in it and currently the only game in town for that is the SD2SNES. You can pick one up at http://shop.retrogate.com

##I'm thinking back on the history of licensed music in videogames, and I notice there's a glaring omission in Zelda 3, is it possible to correct this?
Yes, you can put Rob Zombie's Dragula into Zelda 3 with this patch. You monster.

##How would I do that?
Go on over to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/mwreichelt/Zelda3-MSU-Audio/wiki/Getting-Started) section and find out!

##I found something that's wrong. I think it's a bug.
Please report it in the Issues section and be as detailed as you can about how to reproduce the error. Screenshots are helpful if it only happens in a certain position or if there's a graphical bug.

##Why isn't this done? I could do this myself.
Please understand that I've gotten this far through persistence. Part of why I started this github project is to appeal to those smarter than me. I can't go further on my own and if you have any guidance or changes to the code, please submit them to me. I'll happily update the project so that we can all enjoy a lovely Zelda 3 experience.

In the future, I'd like to host more MSU-1 audio patches, but I'd like to have finished this one before I consider that.

##So you're encouraging piracy, right?
No. No no no no no no no no no no. Please do not pirate games.

##But-
No.

##Then how do I get a ROM?
Dump your own game. Don't copy that floppy. Don't download a car.

##You use a lot of unnecessary commas.
Yes,
